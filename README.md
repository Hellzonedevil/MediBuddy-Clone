# MediBuddy-Clone

_<h2>Purpose<h2>_
This is a MediBuddy clone that I planned to make for a 12th grade Computer Science Project. I used Kivy Module for the Graphic User Interface.
The scope of this app is pretty basic right now but I do plan to make it even better down the road.

_<h2>Additional<h2>_
Make sure you have a `.env` file with `passwd=` set to your SQL password.
The MySQL Database name is set to `medibuddy`. As for the table(s):-

This repository will keep being updated as time goes on and I make more changes.
That's pretty much all you need to know :)
